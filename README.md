# Analysis of Train Accidents in the U.S. During 2001-2016


## Introduction
 
For this particular project, the team has been notionally tasked by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Railway Administration (FRA) to reduce the severity of rail accidents through analysis of 16 years of historical data (2001-2016). The following paper will outline the team's analysis utilizing the Evidence Informed Systems Engineering methodology to help inform FRA decisions outlining: goals, metrics, hypotheses, approach, analysis, evidence, and recommendations. 

Literature review indicates that significant rail accidents in the U.S. have occurred due to either lack of maintenance or train operator negligence. A 2013 train derailment near Bronx, New York, which resulted 64 causalities, was caused by the operator falling asleep and therefore failing to reduce the speed of the train.  A 2008 train-on-train collision in Chatsworth, California, resulted in 125 casualties, because the operator was texting and failed to properly engage the brakes.

One of the primary efforts, from the U.S. Congress and the National Safety Transportation Board (NSTB) has been the universal implementation of positive train control systems. These assistive systems will queue and alert operators at pivot moments during train operations, thereby reducing the likelihood of human errors. However, congressional funding, interoperability, and implementation make the modernization effort very challenging.

The following study utilized railway incident data obtained from the FRA's Office of Safety Analysis [6]. At first glance of the data, there are 52,151 accidents over a 16-year period (2001-2016). We are scoping our research into severe accidents; those accidents that resulted in a high amount of monetary damage or resulted in casualties (injured and loss of life).


## Summary

Accidents caused by human factor failures is the leading issue that plagues railway accidents. The goal of this study is to reduce high cost and casualty inflicting accidents by determining what specific human behaviors were leading to severe accidents. Based on our results, we find that specific human faults are not distinguishable. Moreover, human factor sub-causes are considerably integrated (one fault leads to another). No particular human factor sub-cause is more dangerous than the other. We were able to conclude this finding through a fitted linear model with an overall p-value of 2.2e-16 derived from the model utility test. Based on Evidence Informed Systems Engineering, we recommend expansion of the following two programs that will that will holistically augment human responsibility:

1)	Positive Train Control (PTC). PTC will automatically regulate speed and/or stop the train if the operator fails to do so for a variety of reasons, such as exhaustion, health, and distraction. 

2)	Rail Corridor Risk Management System (RCRMS). RCRMS will improvement route planning and management decisions to reduce the likelihood of operator miscalculations and failures.
